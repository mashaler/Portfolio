                    <h4>From "Hello World" to Real-World Solutions</h4>
                    <hr>
                    <p>In 2019, during my studies at the University of Limpopo, I wrote my first "Hello World" program. It seemed simple, but it marked the start of my journey into coding. Over time, what began as basic coding tasks turned into a passion for building solutions that could make a real impact.</p>
                    <p>After gaining skills in Data Science, Software Development, and App Development, I worked on improving a variety of projects, from banking apps at ABSA Bank to cloud computing at Zensar Technologies. With every challenge I faced—whether it was debugging code or optimizing mobile apps—I learned the value of persistence and the ability to solve complex problems.</p>
                    <p>Now, with years of experience and continuous learning, I’m committed to developing real-world solutions that make a difference, whether through software development or data-driven insights.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>Over the past few years, my journey as a developer has taken me through a diverse set of challenges and opportunities. From my time at the University of Limpopo, where I gained a solid foundation in Computer Science and Statistics, to real-world experience at ABSA Bank, Zensar Technologies, and various personal projects, I've built and optimized applications that solve real-world problems.</p>
                    <p>At ABSA, I had the chance to contribute to iOS banking app features, ensuring a smooth and secure user experience. Working at Zensar as a Cloud Computing Trainee allowed me to dive into cloud-based solutions, collaborating on projects that leveraged Azure services. Each experience has pushed me to grow, both as a developer and a problem solver.</p>
